## Free SVG Logo Maker
This repository was created to allow the users to create free simple logo for their new business, website or project based on 3 set of questions.

This project contain a few files but the files index.js contain the code to run and create a custom logo, this function is possible via nodeJS to allow the project to create files and in this project is to create logo.svg file based on set of questions.

This project is mainly focused on showing up my skills in JS with the integration of NodeJS libraries and improve on it as I progress my journey of learning full stack. 

The logo file name will be created based on the title name of max 3 characters, all logo files will be create with the same name so make sure you take a back up of the existed logo if you have created one before.
